### The input data

A very basic data file:

* each row contains a character and a number separated by space
* the characters represent directions (up, right, down, left): `U`, `R`, `D`, `L`
* the numbers represent the distance/step

Task: we pull a rope in the given direction for the given distance, and we need to figure out,  

### Part one

I will be honest: it was tough. I went down to a super primitive level, and wrote a low-performing code just to do what
needs to be done and get the right result. Currently, I am not even sure, whether my code is actually working well or just
accidentally gives the right result. 

Should I share the code? Well, it's definitely the worst practice.

### Part two

I'm not proud of myself. This is the day I have to give up. I could pass part one, but this one requires skills that I 
don't have yet. I failed. I tried, but couldn't figure out the algorithm. I tried to reuse the functions from the part one,
but it was a complete failure as well. I'm too tired, sad and disappointed now to try again. I give up...

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zgq3nr/2022_day_9_rope_pull/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This is how it should look like visualized.</a>

When I was thinking about the solution, I thought if I treat every knot as a rope-head for the next knot, it will work. But I
couldn't even reproduce the example outputs of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9#part2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">task</a>.

Maybe later I will re-try and update this article... But not today.

### The next day

I was very upset that I couldn't figure out the solution, so I spent my whole Saturday (10th of December) to find a solution.
I analyzed the example in the puzzle description and watched that reddit video of the working solution a million times to
understand the logic behind it. And then I just found it. 

The solution I made for the part one was a total dead end, no wonder why lead me to nowhere. Yes, it accidentally gave the 
right result, but it was a disaster.

The new, working code covers both part one and two, you need only change the value of the `ROPE_LENGTH` constant. I also 
added a print function to be able to visualize the result. For the puzzle example, it will look something like this:
