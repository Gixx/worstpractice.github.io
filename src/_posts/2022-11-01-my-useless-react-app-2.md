### Disclaimer

The [Part 1](/frontend/my-useless-react-app-1) was a shaking up for me from the year-long winter sleep. It was a bit rushy writing, because I didn't wanna
jump in the middle without any warm up. Getting to the very start point was really not a big deal after reading all those blogs, tutorials and watch the

Typescript to the game. Of course, it's a piece of cake now.
