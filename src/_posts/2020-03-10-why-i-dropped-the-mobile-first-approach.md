### The (wrong) decision

It was late 2019. I was working on this blog in my free time since months, and I still couldn't see the end. I was struggling with the
design - as always - and my creativity went into the `not good enough` infinite loop, and started to reject any ideas came up.
Meanwhile the backend part - if we can  talk about backend for a static website - went pretty well. Luckily I could heavily build on
my experiences when I created my family blog the <a href="https://thomas.von.fuerstenfeld.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas von FÃ¼rstenfeld</a>.

It was almost Christmas season, when I finally had a design idea flashed in my mind. Since I felt I'm running out of time, I tried to
sketch it up as simple as possible and drop all the unnecessary things. What remain was the color scheme and the header. That's enough
for the start.

And this was the exact moment when I had to decide what is more important for me:
* Start the blog in the very beginning of 2020, even if the price is I have to drop the `Mobile-first` approach, or
* Do it properly, nice and clean, and maybe I will be able to start only in March 2020?

Since I already had the domain bought in February 2019, I didn't want to waste any time more. I really felt that if I don't publish
this blog in the first days of the New Year, I will get into the `not good enough` rejecting loop again... So I chose to give a damn
on the handheld versions for a while, just do it, publish it.

### The help of the years in the business

Luckily, without really focus on the semantic aspects, I somehow was able to create a nice, clean and tidy `HTML` structure,
and with the guiding help of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://css-tricks.com/abem-useful-adaptation-bem/">ABEM</a>
`CSS` class naming convention, the style definitions were also became pretty flexible. This happens when you stare the monitor
long enough: you get experiences which become skills.

So my own tech blog started, I also wrote my first articles. I shared the links to a small group of developers, to check, read, tell
me the first impressions, etc. Among the many many positive feedback I got, there was one returning topic:

> Where is the mobile version?

I realized, my assumption - that the web developers usually sits in front of a desktop computer and browse the Internet on their 24
inch monitors - was totally wrong.
